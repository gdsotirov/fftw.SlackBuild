fftw: FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)
fftw:
fftw: FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier
fftw: transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size,
fftw: and of both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data,
fftw: i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST). We believe
fftw: that FFTW, which is free software, should become the FFT library
fftw: of choice for most applications.
